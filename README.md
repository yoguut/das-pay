# das-pay

People's payment engine CLI.

## Get started

Clone the repository and then run the following terminal commands in the repo directory:

```bash, ignore
cargo r -- sample_input.csv > sample_output.csv
```

The above command will output a summary of accounts based on the recent transactions within `sample_input`.
If you have a different input file you would like to use, simply point the input csv to your desired file
path.
