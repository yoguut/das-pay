## How to validate file path?

`PathBuf` has a method `exists()` for validating if a file path exists.

## How to abstract CLI module away from core functionality?

> This app should be agnostic to any types of interfaces, since interfaces can be either CLI or a GTK app or QT app or whatever. Its core functionality should be compartmentalized as a shared component.

Looks like Rust kinda treats folders as module itself as long as I have a `mod.rs` file inside of the subdirectory. And then the `main.rs` should be able to import it without problem.

## How to serialize csv into data model?

> I want to have a strongly typed data model to provide basic data validation when handling csv. Assuming the input csv can be potentially large
and may not be sanitized to the correct format. Using a typed data model can be easier for me.

The `serde` crate can provide a outer attribute `#[Debug, Deserialize]` to generate automatic implementation for `Deserialize` a Rust struct.

This feature needs to be explicitly enabled in `Cargo.toml`.

Very nice & clean, but it have abstracted too much implementation details away from beginner learner.

How do I manually implementation its `Deserialize` trait without using the `Deserialize` macro?

## How to print Transaction object?

> I want to see if my serialization method works line by line.

`Transaction` needs to conform to the `fmt::Display` trait in order for the print method to call because the print method doesn't know how to coerce a custom object into string to flash onto the console.

## How do I host std doc locally?

> I want to read the doc of `fmt::Display` to see the required implementation(s).

[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vtjzur/how_to_host_rust_std_docs_on_my_local_machine/)

`
rustup doc --std
`

It kinda worked and opened the doc, but got some problems with my browsers. Meh.

## How to serialize csv into data model of different property identifier with serde?

## How to read app.toml config?

> I want to allow an `app.toml` config file to provide definitions on the number of CPU cores for multi-process tasks.
Because the default implement of Rust's threading topology is N-N, which matches the exact number of CPU cores. This
enhancement allows the app's multi-threaded codes to be flexible and at the same time giving more control to user's
machine.
