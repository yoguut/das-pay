## How to read app.toml config?

I want to allow an `app.toml` config file to provide definitions on the number of CPU cores for multi-process tasks.
Because the default implement of Rust's threading topology is N-N, which matches the exact number of CPU cores. This
enhancement allows the app's multi-threaded codes to be flexible and at the same time giving more control to user's
machine.
