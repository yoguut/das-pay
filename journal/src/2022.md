## How to make lldb work on vscode?

> I want to be able to use breakpoints.

There is permission issue related to the way how I installed vscode via `flatpak`. Guess vim it is.

Although installation via `apt` should circumvent this problem. Next time.

## How to po rust object in LLDB?

> Breakpoints are working on macOS, but idk how to `po` a Rust object.

No idea, deep rabbit hole there. Another time.

## How to validate file path?

`PathBuf` has a method `exists()` for validating if a file path exists.

## How to abstract CLI module away from core functionality?

> This app should be agnostic to any types of interfaces, since interfaces can be either CLI or a GTK app or QT app or whatever. Its core functionality should be compartmentalized as a shared component.

Looks like Rust kinda treats folders as module itself as long as I have a `mod.rs` file inside of the subdirectory. And then the `main.rs` should be able to import it without problem.

## How to serialize csv into data model?

> I want to have a strongly typed data model to provide basic data validation when handling csv. Assuming the input csv can be potentially large
and may not be sanitized to the correct format. Using a typed data model can be easier for me.

> The `serde` crate has pointed out that performing serialization can cause some performance decrease.

The `serde` crate can provide a outer attribute `#[Debug, Deserialize]` to generate automatic implementation for `Deserialize` a Rust struct.

This feature needs to be explicitly enabled in `Cargo.toml`.

Very nice & clean, but it have abstracted too much implementation details away from beginner learner.

How do I manually implementation its `Deserialize` trait without using the `Deserialize` macro?

## How to print Transaction object?

> I want to see if my serialization method works line by line.

`Transaction` needs to conform to the `fmt::Display` trait in order for the print method to call because the print method doesn't know how to coerce a custom object into string to flash onto the console.

## How do I host std doc locally?

> I want to read the doc of `fmt::Display` to see the required implementation(s).

[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vtjzur/how_to_host_rust_std_docs_on_my_local_machine/)

`
rustup doc --std
`

It kinda worked and opened the doc, but got some problems with my browsers. Meh.

## How to serialize csv into data model of different property identifier with serde?

> I don't want to use the word "type" as a property on `Transaction` because it is a reserved keyword.

## How to read app.toml config?

> I want to allow an `app.toml` config file to provide definitions on the number of CPU cores for multi-process tasks.
Because the default implement of Rust's threading topology is N-N, which matches the exact number of CPU cores. This
enhancement allows the app's multi-threaded codes to be flexible and at the same time giving more control to user's
machine.

> Secondly, I want a `models.toml` config file to provide the structure of a data model, so that I can generate a data model instead of hardcoding one. If that's made possible, I can expose a more user friendly frontend by GTK to allow user to edit the data structure if needed, making this app more flexible and capable to deserializing, sanitizing, and then serialize it back into whatever format of a csv the end user want.

`serde` can do it too, lol.
